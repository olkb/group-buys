This is a very simple modifier kit with N9 base and CP legends, meant to work with sets with white and beige alphas, and most sets with alphas that have white legends.

Why a modifier only kit? Well many GMK sets don't have ortholinear support and some of those that do don't even reach MOQ. This set is in N9 due to its broad compatibility with many different alphas. I have tried to keep this set as minimal as possible while making sure that it supports as many different ortholinear keyboards as possible.
